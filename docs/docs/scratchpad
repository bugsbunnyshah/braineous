A data pipeline connects the data source to a target store/system. The data source generates the data and
posts it to the Braineous ingestion system via the Braineous Data Ingestion Java SDK. Braineous
data pipeline engine supports multiple data sources and multiple
target systems that can be associated with a single pipe.
In turn it supports as many pipes that maybe necessary for
the applications in question at scale.
